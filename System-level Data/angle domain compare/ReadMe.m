% This folder contains the files to generate qualitative comparsion of angle spectrums of different detectors

% You can use this code to reproduce Fig. 6 in "Spatial-Domain Mutual Interference Mitigation for MIMO-FMCW Automotive Radar"

% The main file to run is setupSim.m, which configures the interference radar and victim radar systems to simulate
